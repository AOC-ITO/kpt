    Catalog of Config Functions.
---

This repository documents a catalog of functions implementing the
[Configuration Functions Specification][spec].

Run functions either imperatively or declaratively by following the
[Functions User Guide].

Implement configuration functions using any toolchain such as the
[Typescript SDK][ts sdk] or [Golang Libraries][go libs].

## Next Steps

- Learn more ways of using the kpt fn command from the [reference] doc.
- Get a quickstart on writing functions from the [function producer docs].
