<!--  Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:

In your PR, please ensure that you include the following information:
* a description of the change
* the motivation for the change
* what issue it fixes, if any, in GitHub syntax (e.g. Fixes #XYZ)

Both the description and motivation may reference other issues and PRs,
but should be mostly understandable without following the links (e.g. when
reading the git commit log).

If you are updating the documentation, please do it in separate PRs from
code changes. And use the following structure for your documentation PR:
* The first commit in the PR should include the changes to the markdown files and the name of the commit should start with `docs:`.
* The second commit should be the generated content from running `make gendocs`. The commit message should be `regenerate docs`.

**PLEASE REMOVE THIS COMMENT BLOCK BEFORE SUBMITTING THE PR** (the bits
between the arrows)
